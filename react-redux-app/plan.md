Plan:

MVP:


 Build a React Redux app


 Fetch data inside an async action creator from an API of your choosing

 Add the data from the API to the Redux store

 Display the data from the store in a component

 Some styling must be applied. It can be basic, but the app must not only use browser default stylings

What dependencies do I have to install?
1. Redux
2. React-Redux

Choose an api that has :
1. Auth: No
2. HTTPS: Yes
